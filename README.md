# Hangman-Android
Hangman game created in Android Studios using Java, and in collaboration with two other students.
In this project we worked equally and with the mix of pair programming and individual work.

hangman is built on three classes these are - Game, MainActivity and WordList


- Game.Java:

This class is responsible for this game's algorithm. That is, the rules of the game. The task of this class is to first retrieve a word from the class WorldList, storing the amount of inputs and also the amount of wrong inputs by the user. 

- MainActivity:
This class is responsible for the GUI of the game. With the task of retrieving the word from WordList, converting every letter to underscore, displaying the amount of tries failed, converting the underscores to the actual letter if the user guesses correctly.


- WordList:
This class is responsible for the words being used in our hangman game, consisting of 10 words stored in a array.
